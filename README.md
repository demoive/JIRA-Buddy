# JIRA Buddy
A helper for your most common or day-to-day OnDemand JIRA tasks.

## Features
- "Go-to" search box: will either open a new or the existing tab for the JIRA issue submitted
- Ticker - configurable to any [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching) (lots of [samples](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACOM/Example+SQL+queries+for+JIRA) available)

Does not store any sensitive data. This was a choice to prevent unwanted security issues. The extension therefore uses the current session of your browser. If you are not logged in to your OnDemand instance in the browser, the extension won't do much!
